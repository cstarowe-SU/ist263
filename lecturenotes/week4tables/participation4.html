                    <td>I learned about how the city planners of Syracuse intentionally destroyed a predominantly Black neighborhood known as "The Ward" to make I-81. But I-81 only required like 100 feet of right-away, but they used eminent domain to seize several square miles around the highway on both sides and destroyed it all to make housing for doctors, parking garages, and more towers for Upstate Medical. And then the city planners celebrated their success for removing the Black population from Syracuse propper and forcing them into suburbs in the south and south east.</td>
