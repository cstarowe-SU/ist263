    </head>

    <body> 
        My name is Connor Starowesky and I am a communications and rhetoric studies major at Syracuse University.  I am interested in analyzing how humans communicate with each other with implicit communication techniques through modern media.  Outside of my major, I am proficient in Adobe PhotoShop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premier Pro.  I enjoy photography, video games, and working on cars with my friends. I am currently a transportation officer in the New York Army National Guard.  Upon graduation from Syracuse University, I will transition to active duty where I will become a field artillery officer.  My best friend in the world is my rescue dog, Gambino, who is an all-American mutt.
